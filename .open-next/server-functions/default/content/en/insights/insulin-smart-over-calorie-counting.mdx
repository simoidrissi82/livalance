## Insulin sets the tone

Chronically elevated insulin keeps fat locked, cravings loud, and choices reactive. Calorie math matters, but an insulin-smart structure makes it livable.

## Five levers

1. **Sequencing** – Fiber first, then protein/fat, starch last.
2. **Protein + fiber** – 30 g protein plus crunch slows the curve.
3. **Meal breaks** – Start with 12:12, flex up to 14:10 or 16:8 as life allows.
4. **Strength + NEAT** – ≤15-min kettlebells and more steps raise insulin sensitivity.
5. **Stress hygiene** – Down-regulate at night; less cortisol means better glucose.

## Apply it

Pick two meals this week to re-engineer. Rate energy & cravings daily (1–5). Iterate, don’t obsess.
