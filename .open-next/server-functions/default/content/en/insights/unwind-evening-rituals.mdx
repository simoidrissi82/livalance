# Evening Rituals That Stick

Good sleep is a 24-hour practice. These four rituals ease you into rest without adding complexity.

## Dim the Light

Swap bright overhead lighting for warm, indirect lamps or candles after 8 pm to support melatonin.

## Extend Your Exhale

Practice the 4-7-8 breath or simply double the length of your exhale to calm your vagus nerve.

## Close the Loop

Take three minutes to jot down wins, loose ends, and gratitude. Putting thoughts on paper clears cognitive clutter.

## Add Magnesium

Magnesium glycinate or a mineral bath relaxes muscles and signals your body to soften.

## Build the Habit

Attach the ritual to an existing routine—after brushing your teeth or tidying the kitchen—to make it automatic.
