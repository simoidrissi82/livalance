## Why run a short cycle?

Sensors turn invisible habits into signals. Two weeks are enough to see patterns without living wired.

## Week 1 – Observe

- Log meals with a quick photo + note
- Tag movement, stress, and sleep quality
- Highlight spikes >30 mg/dL above baseline

## Week 2 – Iterate

- Apply sequencing tweaks and 10-minute walks after meals
- Anchor 30 g protein per main meal
- Experiment with 12:12 or 14:10 fasting windows

## After the sensor

Synthesize lessons with your coach, set 2–3 anchor habits, remove the sensor, and continue tracking energy + cravings instead of every data point.
