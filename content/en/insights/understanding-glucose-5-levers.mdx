# Quick Start

Five consistent levers help you keep glucose curves steady: sequencing, movement, protein, timing, and sleep. Tweak one habit at a time and observe the impact.

## 1. Sequence Your Meal

Start with fiber-rich veggies, add protein and fats, and finish with starches. Slowing gastric emptying keeps glucose smoother.

## 2. Move Briefly

A brisk 10-minute walk post-meal channels glucose into muscle tissue. Pair it with daylight whenever possible.

## 3. Prioritise Protein

Plan for 20–30 g protein per plate. It keeps you satiated and tempers the impact of carbohydrates.

## 4. Match Timing to Activity

Front-load carbs around training or active work blocks. Choose lighter, protein-forward evening meals.

## 5. Guard Your Sleep

Consistent bedtimes, low light, and evening wind-down rituals protect insulin sensitivity and hunger hormones.

## Keep Iterating

Collect notes between coaching check-ins to see which lever gives you the biggest return. Sustainability beats intensity.
